# Customer-Segmentation
The Customer Segmentation Project used K-Means Clustering to group customers based on purchasing behavior and preferences. Data was cleaned, key features analyzed, and clusters visualized to identify patterns like high-value customers. This helps businesses optimize marketing, improve retention, and deliver personalized recommendations.
In the Customer Segmentation Project, the goal was to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and preferences. Using a dataset containing customer details and transaction history, I implemented K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique, to identify patterns and group customers with similar traits.

Steps Undertaken:
Data Preparation:

Collected and cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing the data for uniformity.
Analyzed key features such as spending habits, purchase frequency, and customer demographics.
Feature Engineering:

Selected relevant attributes like annual income, spending score, and product preferences.
Applied scaling techniques to ensure accurate clustering results.
Model Implementation:

Used Python and libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to implement the K-Means algorithm.
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Visualization and Insights:

Visualized the clusters using scatter plots and other graphical techniques to make the findings interpretable.
Highlighted patterns, such as high-value customers and occasional shoppers, which helped understand customer behavior.
Usefulness in General Terms:
Customer segmentation is a powerful tool for businesses, allowing them to:

Targeted Marketing: Businesses can tailor campaigns to specific customer groups, ensuring higher engagement and ROI.
Improved Customer Retention: By identifying loyal customers and their needs, companies can enhance retention strategies.
Personalized Product Recommendations: Helps in recommending products based on the preferences of each segment.
Resource Optimization: Enables efficient allocation of marketing budgets and resources to focus on high-priority segments.
This project demonstrates the practical application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve real-world business problems and drive data-driven decision-making.
